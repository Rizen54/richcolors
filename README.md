## Usage:
It is as simple as writing `richcolors <hex-codes-filename> <output-pic-filename>`

As far as I have tested it, it can support

* For input files:`.txt` `.md` `.ini` and `.toml`.
* For output files: Everything given in [Pillow's documentation](https://pillow-wiredfool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/image-file-formats.html)
